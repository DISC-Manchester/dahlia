# The Rules

## Rebasing only
Merge commits are looked down upon.
Please rebase your changes to be on top of the branch you are trying to merge to.

## Commits must have reasonable messages
Please describe the general concept that your commit is doing in 60 characters as the first line of the commit message.
If you need to elaborate, do TWO line returns, and write what's required.
